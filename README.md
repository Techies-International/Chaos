Chaos
=====

A Magento module that randomly changes configuration values — useful for developers who want to write bullet proof extensions. 

###Background

Inspired by the Netflix Chaos monkey, Chaos is the start to an extension which provides a framework for swapping configuration node values randomly.  Ships with code that will swap Magento in and out of flat category/product mode at random, helping your team ensure their extensions/customizations work as expected.
